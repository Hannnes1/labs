***  Assignment 1 Bulls and Cows ***

This is the game of Bulls and Cows, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows
Player vs Computer

In this assignment you should use: int's, if, while and functions
(i.e. no switch, no for, no arrays, no string or other!), see Workflow below.

Clarification of rules:
- The computer generates a secret number. This number contains four different digits
  in range 1-9.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- A correct digit in the correct position is a bull.
- A correct digit but in the wrong position is a cow.
- If a digit is counted as bull, it will not count as cow.
- It is recommended that you check if the player's guess is formally correct, i.e.
  has four digits, does not contain zero and has no repeated digits.
  But this is *not* mandatory to be approved.


A sample run (the number to guess is 9582 in this example):

    Welcome to Bulls and Cows
    Try to guess a 4 digit number with digits 1-9
    and no repeating digits (-1 to abort).

    Bulls = correct digits in correct positions.
    Cows = correct digits.

    Guess  > 1234
    There are 0 bulls and 1 cows
    Guess  > 4567
    There are 1 bulls and 0 cows
    Guess  > 3456
    There are 0 bulls and 1 cows
    Guess  > 1298
    There are 0 bulls and 3 cows
    Guess  > 9583
    There are 3 bulls and 0 cows
    Guess  > 9582
    Done, number was 9582 you needed 5 guesses

    With check of players input the last part could look like this:

    Guess > 1234
    There are 0 bulls and 1 cows
    Guess > 12
    Bad guess
    Guess > 12345
    Bad guess
    Guess > 1230
    Bad guess
    Guess > 1223
    Bad guess
    Guess > 4567
    There are 1 bulls and 0 cows
    ...


Hints

Exercises for week1 may be reused!


Workflow
--------
1.  Inspect code and the functional decomposition in the pdf file.

2.  Implement functions bottom up and test. See function test()

2.  When all tests pass. Try to make the game work for one single
    round (implement simplest possible outline).

3.  When a single round works. Surround with a while loop.

4.  Add optional check of user input.
